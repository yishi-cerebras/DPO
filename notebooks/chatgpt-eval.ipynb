That way you wouldn\\'t have to worry about your recommendations coming from several different people whose connections are not necessarily related.  Also, if the academic isn\\'t in the position to help you with this application, you need to think this person is connected because of some type of work or personal relationship, not just because he/she is a colleague. You can only count the work relationship, not the relationship.

Why is there such a big disparity - is the Cambridge course really that condensed or do you learn more in a US degree?\\nResponse A: There are several reasons:  1. In general, the way the U.S. does bachelors degrees is less demanding.  We have four years to achieve our bachelors, while in the U.K. we have five.   In the U.S., if you\\'re a science or engineering major, you\\'re not supposed to even start until your junior or senior year, in part because they have an accelerated curriculum.   2. Science and engineering students are already used to being away from home and having a \"flexible\" lifestyle.  3. U.S. universities generally have extracurricular activities that require time off during school, like club sports, theatre, etc.   4. U.S. universities tend to offer more liberal arts classes, which, while they are demanding, are usually taught during regular classes.\\nResponse B: Ok, so my undergraduate and masters were both from Cambridge and I did an exchange at MIT so I may be able to help out somewhat. In a word, yes, they are pretty comparable.   When you go to Cambridge you attend a college within the university.

       "  'user_query': '\\n\\nHuman: 1st Year PhD - Removed From Project Until recently I was a 1st year PhD student working on my project. However, I was dismissed following my viva under the guise of \"poor writing\" in a continuation report for transfer into the 2nd year. Initially shocked at this sudden change from my supervisor, as we meet weekly to touch base and my writing ability has never been raised as a concern. Going back through the assessors feedback comments from the initial draft, it was generally positive or constructive. i.e make figure x larger, move paragraph y above z. Overall, the report and oral viva were praised for well thought out discussions, sound methodology, good results and clear progression/future plans (all documented) with just a vague \"introduction is poorly written\". However, when pressed the assessor could not/would not expand on this, dismissing me with \"its all poor\" contrary to the feedback he himself had provided! I was told my only options at this stage are to \"withdraw from your course, or submit an MPhil but I will not accept it\". Thus I am appealing this verdict.  After speaking with various staff and peers it has become obviously clear to everyone who has heard the situation that you would ',\n",

I wouldn\\'t be at all surprised if they pulled together the entire file and present it to you on a silver platter, along with all of your emails and papers, and your own sworn statement from all the evidence.   If they just gave you the boot because they don\\'t like that you\\'re \"too much of a workhorse\", they\\'re going to need to explain why your own data is not good enough to support that. They\\'ll need to explain why one set of figures is good enough for peer review, but in your own lab it\\'s not. This is where your whole \"you\\'re a jerk/stupid\" thing comes in.

Institutional guidelines recommend to advise relevant training, workshops, exercises and teaching to address a students weaknesses. I believe this serves as wrongful dismissal/ not adhering to due process of the university. So I\\'ve raised this further to the senior staff.  It has also come to my attention that the lab I was part of is notorious for politics and shady conduct. The student who had the project before me was bullied into leaving. In addition to a high staff turn-over, improper conduct and breaches of contract. From what I hear the uni does nothing about it because the head brings in too much money. \"Poor writing\" just seems to be the excuse to get rid of me, or the project is cursed! Advice on how to navigate this matter would be appreciated.  If the appeal goes through it\\'s doubtful I\\'ll get my previous post/project back as there is too much bad blood. I wouldn\\'t be comfortable remaining at the university if I was moved to another lab/project, if there is systematic abuse and underhanded deals going on. My supervisor is not happy about me digging around/appealing so wouldn\\'t give me a shining reference so seek positions elsewhere.  I\\'ve kept and backed up logs of meetings where no measures were put in place, emails where the supervisor, team and peers have all said the report was of a good standard, and presentations where no concerns were raised. At its core it began as a wrongful dismissal and academic appeal, but the more I look into it, ask around and hear from others experiences with the lab. There\\'s documented evidence of abuse of power, discrimination, harassment/bullying among other serious allegations that the university HAS known about ...but have just brushed  under the rug because they bring in too much money! Not what I would expect from the 18th ranked UK University.\\n\\nAssistant: I keep telling everyone this, UK  higher academia is **HIGHLY UNREGULATED**. It is very easy to pass incompetent people on a PhD programme and kick out competent people on a PhD programme. There are no exams (in most universities to an extent, though some make you do MRes) and very few formal records of what is going on (I had three annual reviews, a transfer viva and viva). If they want to mess around with you, it\\'s very easy. If you smell a rat, run. Don\\'t waste 4 years only to be shown the door with a MPhil. Or even worse they take your 4 years, take your money, take your effort and kick you out right at the viva with no resubmission.  If you don\\'t trust your supervisor, **DO NOT** and I repeat **DO NOT** stay. He or she is the only one who is going to back you at the viva. If you think your supervisor is out to get you, start recording and documenting evidence. Make a complaint and leave. These people will never let you pass if they don\\'t want to.

My interactions with students are my weekly office hours and grading their exams and assignments. This is where the problem begins: After every homework or exam that I grade, many students come challenging their grades by saying a variation of (i) \"My answer is same as the solution manual but I didn\\'t get full credit.\", (ii) \"My solution is correct and solution manual is wrong.\" or (iii) \"My solution is same as my friend\\'s but my grade is lower.\"  Aside Info: Even if the subject (taught at this level) is not really mathematical -other than being able to do primary school operations on numbers and comparing them with each other-, I guess it requires some sort of mathematical maturity to avoid fallacies. So answers to each question requires a \"proof,\" even though it is usually a one-liner but the students often lack the background to do it, which is somewhat surprising\\nResponse A: of them are seniors with some juniors at a good university.  I don\\'t know the institutional reasons for the lack of background of the students and I understand that it may not be their fault that they were allowed to take this class without the proper background. However, I cannot possibly teach them proof techniques or basic logic either. I mean, they don\\'t even need to write technical proofs, I just need a decently complete arguments about why some simple statement is true or false. To make this easier for them, I always write very clear solutions to each question after they submit their work, explain it step by step and show/argue that if you omit even one step, the answer would be incomplete.  Here is an example that illustrates the type of answers I get very often: \"Every prime number other than 2 is odd since for example 3 is odd.\" (The actual subject concerns much simpler problems but this shows the type of fallacies I deal with on a daily basis.) Then, they argue that they deserve full credit, since they rightfully argued that \"Every prime number other than 2 is odd\".  I explain that their end result might be correct but their method is not; that this class is all about teaching the methods, and finally that the question explicitly requires an explanation which should be correct for the answer to be considered correct, hence they don\\'t deserve full credit for it. (I feel embarrassed that I need to say things like this since it feels like an insult to their intelligence; if the question is not a multiple choice or \"Fill in the black\", these should be fairly obvious. Yet, I dealt with this for years now.) Then, they complain to the professor about this. I talk to the professor about it and we have a good laugh. (I don\\'t remember any instance where a professor sided with the students about this issue and the professors are some of the top people in this field in the world so at this point I am fairly confident about my grading system.) This process repeats itself every week, every year.  I am sorry, I haven\\'t had chance to rant about this in a while so I got a little carried away while trying to give some background. So, is there a systematic solution to my problem? What are your suggestions? I think I will suggest to the professor that we upload a practice problem set with the detailed solutions next term before the deadline for the first homework to set their expectations about our expectations but I don\\'t know if this will work. So, I am open to any suggestion (that a reasonable professor would accept) at this point.\\n\\nAssistant: They\\'re probably thinking there\\'s no downside to arguing about their grades, and some kids love to do that, so one thing you could do is promise to lower their grade if they complain about something that they\\'re wrong about.  In other words, provide a disincentive for frivolous complaints.  Some kids will try to argue their grade almost no matter what, they\\'ve probably been doing it for years in all their classes.  This sort of thing happened to me in an intro to analysis class as an undergrad.  We had a friend who would write down the axioms, write down the theorem we were trying to prove, and then write down a bunch of nonsense in between.  When we called him on the nonsense he didn\\'t understand what we were talking about, so we\\'d have to explicitly disprove his \"proof\" to show why it wasn\\'t a proof.  He drove the TA nuts too.  I\\'m not sure how clearly you\\'re explaining/showing why the method is wrong, but you might want to be more explicit about it if you\\'re just taking off points without explaining exactly why.  It might take you a bit more time, which is annoying.  For instance, in response to, \"Every prime number other than 2 is odd since for example 3 is odd,\" you might write, \"One example doesn\\'t imply a proof.  It doesn\\'t make sense to say that every tennis player other than Novak Djokovic has the first name Roger since for example Roger Federer is named Roger.\"\\nResponse B: Thanks for posting again.

I explain that their end result might be correct but their method is not; that this class is all about teaching the methods, and finally that the question explicitly requires an explanation which should be correct for the answer to be considered correct, hence they don\\'t deserve full credit for it. (I feel embarrassed that I need to say things like this since it feels like an insult to their intelligence; if the question is not a multiple choice or \"Fill in the black\", these should be fairly obvious. Yet, I dealt with this for years now.) Then, they complain to the professor about this. I talk to the professor about it and we have a good laugh. (I don\\'t remember any instance where a professor sided with the students about this issue and the professors are some of the top people in this field in the world so at this point I am fairly confident about my grading system.) This process repeats itself every week, every year.  I am sorry, I haven\\'t had chance to rant about this in a while so I got a little carried away while trying to give some background. So, is there a systematic solution to my problem? What are your suggestions? I think I will suggest to the professor that we upload a practice problem set with the detailed solutions next term before the deadline for the first homework to set their expectations about our expectations but I don\\'t know if this will work. So, I am open to any suggestion (that a reasonable professor would accept) at this point.\\n\\nAssistant: They\\'re probably thinking there\\'s no downside to arguing about their grades, and some kids love to do that, so one thing you could do is promise to lower their grade if they complain about something that they\\'re wrong about.  In other words, provide a disincentive for frivolous complaints.  Some kids will try to argue their grade almost no matter what, they\\'ve probably been doing it for years in all their classes.  This sort of thing happened to me in an intro to analysis class as an undergrad.  We had a friend who would write down the axioms, write down the theorem we were trying to prove, and then write down a bunch of nonsense in between.  When we called him on the nonsense he didn\\'t understand what we were talking about, so we\\'d have to explicitly disprove his \"proof\" to show why it wasn\\'t a proof.  He drove the TA nuts too.  I\\'m not sure how clearly you\\'re explaining/showing why the method is wrong, but you might want to be more explicit about it if you\\'re just taking off points without explaining exactly why.  It might take you a bit more time, which is annoying.  For instance, in response to, \"Every prime number other than 2 is odd since for example 3 is odd,\" you might write, \"One example doesn\\'t imply a proof.  It doesn\\'t make sense to say that every tennis player other than Novak Djokovic has the first name Roger since for example Roger Federer is named Roger.\"',\n",

Or that you won’t have time to dedicate to the project? I don’t think you can really move forward without doing some excavation of what exactly it is that is holding you back.

So I am looking for inspiration for time management.\\n\\nAssistant: Tl;dr: If you\\'re working every day, 12 hours a day in a PhD program, you\\'re doing it wrong or you\\'re in a toxic lab.  I\\'m a PhD student in a Pharmacology program.  I don\\'t work 12 hours a day.  I work closer to 7-9 hours during the week and pick up a couple of hours on the weekend if I need to for experiments/deadlines.  On average, I work 40-50 hours a week.  A weekday for me would look something like this (no classes):  * 6:15 AM: wake up, get ready (hair, makeup, feed cat, etc), brush teeth, check the weather, eat a light breakfast like cereal * 7:45-8:15 AM: arrive to lab, look at my list of duties and calendar, plan my day, work, read, etc * 4:45-6:15 PM: get home, this varies depending on my workday * 4:50 PM: Go for a jog (~3-4 miles, 30 minutes) * 5:30 PM: shower/meal prep * 6:00 PM: dinner and netflix/hulu/TV * 7:00 PM: feed and love cat/clean up/dishes/start laundry/grocery shop/etc * 8:00 PM: check e-mail/read/free-time * 10-11 PM: sleep  There is a lot that can vary in this schedule in the evening for me based on my needs.  I have a lot of time to spend to grocery shop, run errands, do laundry, clean, maintain personal hygeine, etc.  Honestly, you just have to make time for chores and the other things on your list like any other working adult.  Some tips I have that make my life easier:  * The slow cooker is one of my best friends for cooking.  I\\'ll throw in some meat with seasoning in the morning on low, come home, shred it, chop up some veggies I picked up from the store the night before, and I have some easy meat and veggies for tacos or a rice bowl.  I make a bunch so I have leftovers to freeze or refridgerate. * If you have trouble picking out clothing or getting ready in the morning, set out your clothes the night before * When you\\'re at work, spending time working.  Oftentimes, if I hear of a PhD spending 12-14 hours a day in the laboratory, I can almost guarantee that person is not constantly working while they are there or their advisor is a jerk.  Take breaks, sure, but set out your tasks ahead of time and work to get them done. * Planning a schedule or writing down my work tasks for a day helps me manage my time at work better than just keeping a mental note of all the things I need to do. * No one tracks my hours so if I need to step out to go to the post office or to a dr\\'s appointment during the day I can.  No one gets upset at me.  Just make time for those things. * For a pet, I have a cat.  My cat does a pretty good job at maintaining herself without me there all the time.  I feed her in the morning, feed her at night, clean her litter box, and spend some time with her.  She doesn\\'t need constant monitoring, she\\'s a pretty low maintenance pet to have.  I know students who have dogs and they make it work.\\nResponse B: It\\'s quite possible. The way I look at it is, you need to balance it out so that, at the end of your week or even day, you can say \"I did what needs to be done\" instead of \"I did what I could\". I think I only need 3 hours every single morning just to meet the bills. On certain days, depending on how I get them accomplished, I might just get up half an hour early just so I can do something, even if it doesn\\'t end up being done within the rest of the day. But still, as long as I\\'ve done what was really needed at the end of the day, that\\'s enough for me.\\nI guess your dilemma is, you have certain things, which are vital, you need to do everyday.

So I am looking for inspiration for time management.\\n\\nAssistant: Tl;dr: If you're working every day, 12 hours a day in a PhD program, you're doing it wrong or you're in a toxic lab.  I'm a PhD student in a Pharmacology program.  I don't work 12 hours a day.  I work closer to 7-9 hours during the week and pick up a couple of hours on the weekend if I need to for experiments/deadlines.  On average, I work 40-50 hours a week.  A weekday for me would look something like this (no classes):  * 6:15 AM: wake up, get ready (hair, makeup, feed cat, etc), brush teeth, check the weather, eat a light breakfast like cereal * 7:45-8:15 AM: arrive to lab, look at my list of duties and calendar, plan my day, work, read, etc * 4:45-6:15 PM: get home, this varies depending on my workday * 4:50 PM: Go for a jog (~3-4 miles, 30 minutes) * 5:30 PM: shower/meal prep * 6:00 PM: dinner and netflix/hulu/TV * 7:00 PM: feed and love cat/clean up/dishes/start laundry/grocery shop/etc * 8:00 PM: check e-mail/read/free-time * 10-11 PM: sleep  There is a lot that can vary in this schedule in the evening for me based on my needs.  I have a lot of time to spend to grocery shop, run errands, do laundry, clean, maintain personal hygeine, etc.  Honestly, you just have to make time for chores and the other things on your list like any other working adult.  Some tips I have that make my life easier:  * The slow cooker is one of my best friends for cooking.  I'll throw in some meat with seasoning in the morning on low, come home, shred it, chop up some veggies I picked up from the store the night before, and I have some easy meat and veggies for tacos or a rice bowl.  I make a bunch so I have leftovers to freeze or refridgerate. * If you have trouble picking out clothing or getting ready in the morning, set out your clothes the night before * When you're at work, spending time working.  Oftentimes, if I hear of a PhD spending 12-14 hours a day in the laboratory, I can almost guarantee that person is not constantly working while they are there or their advisor is a jerk.  Take breaks, sure, but set out your tasks ahead of time and work to get them done. * Planning a schedule or writing down my work tasks for a day helps me manage my time at work better than just keeping a mental note of all the things I need to do. * No one tracks my hours so if I need to step out to go to the post office or to a dr's appointment during the day I can.  No one gets upset at me.  Just make time for those things. * For a pet, I have a cat.  My cat does a pretty good job at maintaining herself without me there all the time.  I feed her in the morning, feed her at night, clean her litter box, and spend some time with her.  She doesn't need constant monitoring, she's a pretty low maintenance pet to have.  I know students who have dogs and they make it work.\",\n",

Hello everyone, I am a female undergraduate in physics at a reputable university. I will be graduating in a year and am starting to look at PhD programs. Recently I joined a new research group in a subject that I am highly interested in, but do not have a lot of background in. Prior to this I was in a research group for a little over a year, but in a completely different field. The second I heard back from the new group I basically had a panic attack: I felt fraudulent, like I somehow tricked them into saying yes; thoughts that I\\'m not smart or accomplished enough keep crossing my mind even still.   I\\'ve heard of impostor syndrome and realized that what I\\'m experiencing is consistent with some of the things I\\'ve heard about it; however, just recognizing that what I\\'m experiencing is normal doesn\\'t help very much. I feel a lot of self-doubt and I find myself avoiding the work for the group because I\\'m afraid of not understanding something and looking stupid. I know a lot of graduate students go through this, so what are some tips to help get over this self doubt and fear of \\nResponse A: sistant: First year grad student here, so your post resonated pretty heavily with me. I\\'ll try to share some of what I\\'ve gone through and what I\\'ve found has helped me so far.  I came from an undergrad university that is significantly less prestigious than my current graduate university, so that was nerve wracking to begin with. The fact that I was going to be classmates with people from Ivy League schools, or MIT, or Cal Tech, etc etc made me doubt whether I deserved to be in the school I\\'m in. And once classes started up, I felt even worse. I had no idea what was going on half the time, and I assumed everyone else was miles ahead of me.

Prior to this I was in a research group for a little over a year, but in a completely different field.

I've heard of impostor syndrome and realized that what I'm experiencing is consistent with some of the things I've heard about it; however, just recognizing that what I'm experiencing is normal doesn't help very much.

I found the PhD exponentially more stressful than my MA. A counselor helps manage stress and gives techniques for making progress in work while also acknowledging that the anxiety and the emotions still exist. A lot of schools also offer support groups where grad students get together once a week to help one another. You\\'d probably benefit from this.  There are a lot of books out there for help with grad school and writing. Silvia\\'s How to Write A Lot is one and Booth\\'s The Craft of Research is another. But I didn\\'t find a magic key that told me how to succeed. I got finished because I had a daily schedule that I did 6 days a week and I really stuck to it.

I've also upset my masters advisor for not meeting the schedule that we agreed upon.... I still can't breath well just thinking about it.   **How do you guys deal with the anxiety? Do you have tips or tricks for me to calm down and get to work properly? **  I want to fix this issue and improve before I start my PhD program, which is going to be much longer and I will be tied down with much more responsibilities (TA, more courses, etc.)... I hope this wasn't a total waste of your time. Thanks for reading.\\n\\nAssistant: Most universities have counseling support for graduate students. I found the PhD exponentially more stressful than my MA. A counselor helps manage stress and gives techniques for making progress in work while also acknowledging that the anxiety and the emotions still exist. A lot of schools also offer support groups where grad students get together once a week to help one another. You'd probably benefit from this.  There are a lot of books out there for help with grad school and writing. Silvia's How to Write A Lot is one and Booth's The Craft of Research is another. But I didn't find a magic key that told me how to succeed. I got finished because I had a daily schedule that I did 6 days a week and I really stuck to it. The actually structure changed depending on teaching schedules and my own coursework, qualifying exam study, and then dissertation writing.\",\n",

That will vary with different contexts and will vary with students. I mean, it shouldn\\'t take too long, but at this point I have a student in my lab asking me how to start a study because he believes everyone else is doing more interesting things, lol.  In general, in research, it takes more than that to start doing an interesting experiment or to be able publish it.  When you join a new lab it might take a couple weeks to get a working schedule worked out with your lab director and maybe a week to get comfortable enough to have a talk with a lab member who is actually doing something, get an idea for an experiment, and if you want to actually do it. I think 2-3months after you join.

That will vary with different contexts and will vary with students. I mean, it shouldn't take too long, but at this point I have a student in my lab asking me how to start a study because he believes everyone else is doing more interesting things, lol.  In general, in research, it takes more than that to start doing an interesting experiment or to be able publish it.  When you join a new lab it might take a couple weeks to get a working schedule worked out with your lab director and maybe a week to get comfortable enough to have a talk with a lab member who is actually doing something, get an idea for an experiment, and if you want to actually do it.

I have worked extremely hard to climb the academic ladder, and I feel pretty content with how successful I have been.   Here is where the real fun comes in.

From diagnosis to her passing, it was 5 months. To say this took a toll on me is an understatement. Meanwhile, the chair knew everything I was going through, and her response to my mom passing was \"time to get back to real life\". My leave officially started in October, and I received emails that were full of things that should not be said to anyone let alone someone already struggling with other life experiences. I\\'ve been in contact with the dean and she just says \"I dont know why she treats you like this\". The chair says \"hes like a son to me\" as if its some excuse to justify the abuse. She threatens that there are consequences, and told me I am shooting myself in the foot for now doing what she says. This was sent to the dean, union, and legal counsel. They told her to leave me alone during leave, but it will, without a doubt continue. After forwarding the harassing emails, the dean went MIA and hasn\\'t said a word in months. I got in contact with my union, legal counsel and HR and they basically told her to leave me alone. From October until this past week, she left me alone. Now the emails start again. Nothing toxic, but right back to as if things are normal and what she did is just acceptable. This experience is only the recent one, I have recordings, and emails from the past 10 years of things similar and perhaps worse. She is short tempered, and respects no one. She, and other say its just her culture (shes turkish). Its still mind boggling to me that if this were any other job, she would have been fired. There are recordings others have sent the union of her being racist. Yet, she still continues as if nothing has happened.   The overall response from the dean was \"I need her as chair\". The chair is tenured, and intends to retire in 3 years. I don\\'t want to see, hear or have anything to do with this woman. Just the thought of speaking with her gives me extreme anxiety. I wish this was an exaggeration, but every single interaction I have had with her has been abusing, toxic. Sadly, I am not alone in this.

I’m a PhD scholar from a minority community in my country and during the first year of my PhD, I had received afellowship (scholarship) grant of 5 years under some central government minority scheme. I’m in the beginning of my 5th year now and I just recently found out (from payment schedule) that the fellowship will end in March of 2023 which equals payment of 4.3 years out of 5. (My PhD tenure will end in October 2023) Is there anything I can do to get full 5 years fellowship? What would you do if it were you in my position?\\nResponse A: I\\'m an assistant professor in the US with an AAAS NRSA. During my post-doc I did the math and it turns out the grant I got was for 5 years. But the actual time I had AAAS money for the fellowship was 4.3 years.  I got a small stipend and I had to get funding for my travel and child care for the duration. When I arrived, I asked \"why is my post-doc not a fellowship?\" And they told me. The grant I ended up with only went for the time during the post-doc.\\nResponse B: I work in HR at a uni maintaining Postdoc profiles - our 5 years are based off of the hire dates.

Also, he has been delaying publications for months and months and yet had the time to make a poster based on the work that he claims he hasn\\'t had the time to get to.   3.\\\\) If I am going to say something, do you have any advice on what I should say or how I should frame the issue?

Initially shocked at this sudden change from my supervisor, as we meet weekly to touch base and my writing ability has never been raised as a concern. Going back through the assessors feedback comments from the initial draft, it was generally positive or constructive. i.e make figure x larger, move paragraph y above z.

After speaking with various staff and peers it has become obviously clear to everyone who has heard the situation that you would \\nResponse A: omeone for poor writing, if that is indeed the case. Institutional guidelines recommend to advise relevant training, workshops, exercises and teaching to address a students weaknesses. I believe this serves as wrongful dismissal/ not adhering to due process of the university. So I\\'ve raised this further to the senior staff.  It has also come to my attention that the lab I was part of is notorious for politics and shady conduct. The student who had the project before me was bullied into leaving. In addition to a high staff turn-over, improper conduct and breaches of contract. From what I hear the uni does nothing about it because the head brings in too much money. \"Poor writing\" just seems to be the excuse to get rid of me, or the project is cursed! Advice on how to navigate this matter would be appreciated.  If the appeal goes through it\\'s doubtful I\\'ll get my previous post/project back as there is too much bad blood. I wouldn\\'t be comfortable remaining at the university if I was moved to another lab/project, if there is systematic abuse and underhanded deals going on. My supervisor is not happy about me digging around/appealing so wouldn\\'t give me a shining reference so seek positions elsewhere.  I\\'ve kept and backed up logs of meetings where no measures were put in place, emails where the supervisor, team and peers have all said the report was of a good standard, and presentations where no concerns were raised. At its core it began as a wrongful dismissal and academic appeal, but the more I look into it, ask around and hear from others experiences with the lab. There\\'s documented evidence of abuse of power, discrimination, harassment/bullying among other serious allegations that the university HAS known about ...but have just brushed  under the rug because they bring in too much money! Not what I would expect from the 18th ranked UK University.\\n\\nAssistant: OP, the same thing happened to me, this was on the Economics PhD Programme at the University of Surrey. They took my money and kicked me off the programme in my first year saying I was not up to standard, I went to another university in the UK and got my PhD a few months ago. There is a lot of shady politics in UK academia, the people who stay on and do well are the ones who are arse-licking the professors and heads of department. If you create a scene or threatens someone\\'s job (by even being better at your job than them) they will find a way to kick you out.  My best advice for you is to complain to the highest level, the vice-chancellor of the university and find another PhD programme. It\\'s better to leave early than to be messed around for 4 years and not even get your degree. I wish you the best OP.\\nResponse B: The reason you might be facing bad reviews is because you have an unreasonable expectation of what constitutes a \"good\" report. I agree that it is unreasonable to think that your supervisor is going to provide an overly generous review if you haven\\'t asked for it or even if it is your last report period with the PI. This is a huge missed opportunity in your career. Your reviews aren\\'t always about what you have already done; it is about how you might help the PI accomplish their objectives. If you have strong suggestions to improve your PI\\'s lab, why not help him/her out by providing them? Is this simply not possible in your position? Are you not willing to be honest about what you think needs to happen in order to get the PI to achieve their goals? Your review is a chance to show that you\\'re not only ready to carry out your research, but also someone who has the drive to make it improve and evolve, whether that means helping the PI find the next stage of their work or proposing alternative and interesting directions.  I find that PIs are often not the right person to write and/or give your review.

It has also come to my attention that the lab I was part of is notorious for politics and shady conduct. The student who had the project before me was bullied into leaving. In addition to a high staff turn-over, improper conduct and breaches of contract. From what I hear the uni does nothing about it because the head brings in too much money. \"Poor writing\" just seems to be the excuse to get rid of me, or the project is cursed! Advice on how to navigate this matter would be appreciated.  If the appeal goes through it\\'s doubtful I\\'ll get my previous post/project back as there is too much bad blood. I wouldn\\'t be comfortable remaining at the university if I was moved to another lab/project, if there is systematic abuse and underhanded deals going on. My supervisor is not happy about me digging around/appealing so wouldn\\'t give me a shining reference so seek positions elsewhere.  I\\'ve kept and backed up logs of meetings where no measures were put in place, emails where the supervisor, team and peers have all said the report was of a good standard, and presentations where no concerns were raised.

They took my money and kicked me off the programme in my first year saying I was not up to standard, I went to another university in the UK and got my PhD a few months ago. There is a lot of shady politics in UK academia, the people who stay on and do well are the ones who are arse-licking the professors and heads of department. If you create a scene or threatens someone\\'s job (by even being better at your job than them) they will find a way to kick you out.

Being mentally prepared for that ahead of time can helps soften the impact if it. 3) A lot of connections happen after the conference. People will often go out afterwards to drink/talk and will be more relaxed. Great opportunity to try and (respectfully) make a connection. Sometimes the big vendors will host a party at a local restaurant/bar (you might see these advertised at a vendor exhibition showroom if they have one). These can be a big hotspots for social activity. Since you dont have anyone you’re going with, check ahead of time if there’s anyone you know that has connections to ppl that will be at the conference.',\n",

It\\'s pretty competitive, especially in more expensive areas like New England (where I am currently).     It appears to me you applied for a position that was fairly competitive (given the number of other people who applied) and you accepted it.     That\\'s cool but you\\'re also assuming you got the lowest offer by another professor instead of the highest offer by another professor.   Also, you\\'re working to get your PhD in a hard science like physics that you can\\'t get your PhD in without a specific job offer.     Just as you accepted your offer, you also applied to other jobs in other areas and/or submitted your dissertation for review.

Luckily my supervisors spoke English well but my colleagues in my lab did not. The administration is a complicated, the people can be cold and standoffish, and the atmosphere can quickly become depressing.  Secondly, my advice about the country: Take a deep breath and get proactive. This country is known for its standoffish people when it comes to language. BUT there are many expats and travellers here. I advise you to seek out other international PhD students in your team/lab/building/university. Look for English Libraries and join in. Check your doctoral school and attend a mixer or two. 100% there are other international students who are struggling too, and there are probably PhDs of the country who can speak English and would be willing to help here and there for translation. Build your support network!  Thirdly, administration. It gets easier after the first year after you are in the system. I know it sucks to get all the cards and forms and applications filled in. But it WILL get simpler. After my third year I didn\\'t even blink an eye at the paperwork anymore, just keep on top of it! Do it immediately and keep copies of all the documents in a folder so when you have to apply for residene permits etc. again, you have it already.  Lastly, and probably the most important for you, your PhD and supervisors. I assume you are in your first year? Honestly, if you feel the need to quit do it. There is no shame in it and it takes immense strength to look at the big picture of your life and say \"This isn\\'t working\".

Seek counselling if you can (there should be free services available to you, speak to the International Researchers office of your university to find resources - ask for counselling options and help with administration). As for your supervisors - only you know how bad it really is. I would not directly approach your supervisors and tell them you\\'re not happy. I don\\'t think they would be receptive to this.

But it WILL get simpler. After my third year I didn\\'t even blink an eye at the paperwork anymore, just keep on top of it!

And do you have any advice on someone who desires to do both? As a product of a community college and a research university, I\\'ve found myself dreaming of working at both.            My closest connections with faculty happened at a community college; some of who I still talk to occasionally (6 years after transfer). They taught me the value of knowledge and part of me likes the idea of focusing on teaching the highly diverse CC population.             When I was at university, I fell in love with my field. The process of deeply learning, asking questions, and participating as an RA in the research process was incredible. My dream of being an academic researcher really bloomed from these experiences.                      I received my undergrad degree in December 2016 and if the whole COVID situation taught me one thing, it\\'s that I made a mistake leaving the academic space. Looking back, I was so lucky to have found a community and \\nResponse A: onging at only 18. But I was afraid of the poor job prospects (I\\'m in anthro), how my social anxiety could swell in a front-facing people-oriented job, and I was terrified of not being good enough to go to grad school (so I never even tried applying).               Unfortunately, my fear over these things has only increased with time but I figure I may as well try. Probably not until next year because my mind has really taken a beating with the events of 2020 and I haven\\'t been able to sufficiently prep for this application cycle. But as I\\'m pondering what path I want to take, I feel lost... If I choose to go the CC route, will getting a PhD make my job prospects better or worse?\\n\\nAssistant: I\\'m not at a community college, but I know someone that teaches in anthropology that suggested picking up 18 graduate hours in either psychology or sociology so you could teach in two social sciences and increase your usefulness at a CC.   You are right to worry about jobs.  I looked at my local CC and they had 13 full-time faculty in psychology, 5 in sociology, and 1 in anthropology.  Even with the adjuncts they had listed, psychology had 34, sociology had 11, and anthropology had 1.  I then looked at a smaller CC the next town over.  They had 5 full time psychology faculty, 3 in sociology, and don\\'t even offer anthropology.  At both schools, they each had a faculty member that was listed as dual in sociology and psychology which maybe gives a little credence to my friend\\'s advice.\\nResponse B: If you want to try some things and see what works, great. But it is still the traditional grad school route. If you want to do something different with your life, that is fine. But you must remember that if nothing happens through any of those paths, it is just life and that is just what happens to you. It is a good idea to choose a program to find something you find rewarding, but at the end of the day, whether or not you go to grad school, get a job, retire, etc., the only difference will be that your next step is whatever that happens to be.

As a product of a community college and a research university, I've found myself dreaming of working at both.            My closest connections with faculty happened at a community college; some of who I still talk to occasionally (6 years after transfer). They taught me the value of knowledge and part of me likes the idea of focusing on teaching the highly diverse CC population.             When I was at university, I fell in love with my field. The process of deeply learning, asking questions, and participating as an RA in the research process was incredible. My dream of being an academic researcher really bloomed from these experiences.                      I received my undergrad degree in December 2016 and if the whole COVID situation taught me one thing, it's that I made a mistake leaving the academic space.

It is a good idea to choose a program to find something you find rewarding, but at the end of the day, whether or not you go to grad school, get a job, retire, etc., the only difference will be that your next step is whatever that happens to be.

Unfortunately, my fear over these things has only increased with time but I figure I may as well try. Probably not until next year because my mind has really taken a beating with the events of 2020 and I haven't been able to sufficiently prep for this application cycle. But as I'm pondering what path I want to take, I feel lost... If I choose to go the CC route, will getting a PhD make my job prospects better or worse?\\n\\nAssistant: I'm not at a community college, but I know someone that teaches in anthropology that suggested picking up 18 graduate hours in either psychology or sociology so you could teach in two social sciences and increase your usefulness at a CC.   You are right to worry about jobs.  I looked at my local CC and they had 13 full-time faculty in psychology, 5 in sociology, and 1 in anthropology.  Even with the adjuncts they had listed, psychology had 34, sociology had 11, and anthropology had 1.  I then looked at a smaller CC the next town over.  They had 5 full time psychology faculty, 3 in sociology, and don't even offer anthropology.  At both schools, they each had a faculty member that was listed as dual in sociology and psychology which maybe gives a little credence to my friend's advice.\",\n",

I mean, they don\\'t even need to write technical proofs, I just need a decently complete arguments about why some simple statement is true or false.

Then, they argue that they deserve full credit, since they rightfully argued that \"Every prime number other than 2 is odd\".

They wanted to turn the project into something publishable and I agreed thinking I could do it. We had bumps along the way with figuring out how to do our project and it somewhat changed so now it's just taking longer to complete. I've since graduated in 2020 and am still working on this with them (2yrs on this project) but after I graduated, I really just wanted to move on and have the project passed on to another undergrad to finish, though I know I've made a commitment to create this paper with them. I honestly don't care about having my name first on the publication at this point - which was something that enticed me at first being an undergrad.

My PI didn't like it and we had a few discussions of whether she should fire me. I am glad to be gone  Now it does look poor on the resume but I have been out for two years and I have no regrets.

Some Background:   I graduated recently with my PhD and I have been trying to turn my dissertation chapters into published articles. My supervisor has been sitting on these manuscripts for months \\\\(one since November \\\\-\\\\-\\\\- 5 months ago\\\\) saying he hasn\\'t found the time to read them and send feedback. This is despite the fact that I stressed to him several times how critical these publications were to me getting a job and building a career \\\\(I do not yet have any publications from my PhD time\\\\). I was lucky enough to secure a post\\\\-doc anyways, despite my publication record \\\\(although  I lost out on 3 before that specifically for that reason\\\\), on the premise that these publications were forthcoming.  The Current Issue:  I was not able to attend a major conference this year, but a colleague contacted me to tell me they saw \"my poster,\" which I didn\\'t know I had.  It turns out my former supervisor had mad\\nResponse A: ce poster based on a chapter from my dissertation without telling me. In fact, the graphs are copy and pasted from the chapter/manuscript that he \"hasn\\'t had time to read\" since November. Moreover, he listed himself as the first author and as far as I can tell didn\\'t even cite my dissertation \\\\(My friend sent me a blurry picture of the poster\\\\). He did list me as the second author.  So, I could use some advice.  1.\\\\) Is this unethical behavior? My instinct is that it\\'s at least borderline unethical, but I don\\'t want to blow this out of proportion. The fact that he did not tell me bothers me for several reasons including not knowing to add the poster to my CV \\\\(which I need since he hasn\\'t let me publish\\\\) and the fact that I feel like he gave himself more credit for this work than he deserves \\\\(Yes, it\\'s his lab\\'s research but I did a significant proportion of the work involved\\\\).  2.\\\\) Should I say something? If this is unethical behavior, I do not think I should let it slide as that will only encourage him to do stuff like this to future students, nor do I want to set a precedent of being a push\\\\-over \\\\(for myself and to others\\\\). Also, he has been delaying publications for months and months and yet had the time to make a poster based on the work that he claims he hasn\\'t had the time to get to.   3.\\\\) If I am going to say something, do you have any advice on what I should say or how I should frame the issue?   I am worried about how this will play out in the future. I no longer need a letter of recommendation from this person for jobs \\\\(which is why I held my tongue in regards to previous issues I had with him\\\\), but I do need to finish several publications with him which I really need for my career and to show my current job I wasn\\'t BS\\'ing about having forthcoming publications.   Thank you for any advice or suggestions!\\n\\nAssistant: Authors of anything — meeting abstracts, manuscripts — are expected to notify and get the endorsement of anyone whose name is included on that work. He should have told you, at the very least.\\nResponse B: There are a number of ways to handle this.   My approach is to be proactive about addressing the issue and making sure it\\'s a non-issue - but not an overt concern.  If it\\'s an issue of credit that needs to be sorted out, that can be handled by going through your lab policy to ensure they clearly communicate to everyone ahead of time that all work is collaborative and everyone owns the results of their team and team building work.  There are many other ways to communicate with researchers about issues too.   You don\\'t want to say that someone is slacking.  Don\\'t label him as doing \"bad\" work.

I don't think it takes a lot of time to get a feel for how the peer review process works these days. Maybe a few days or week. Most of those rejections are going to be form rejections now, and I got to the point where I could identify the type just by looking at the cover letter.  So I spent about 4 years getting used to it and then I started to do it better.  You will start to have rejections as well, which is frustrating, especially if you spent a year or more preparing material for a particular journal.  But once you get to a point where you are sending out 2 or 3 times per week, it becomes fairly routine and you won't really notice how bad it is until you're up to a dozen or more.  And, trust me, when you're up to that number then it's bad.   Don't get discouraged. That first year is going to be a killer.

Earlier this year, the US Department of Labor made rules raising the minimum salary without overtime pay to $47K/year.  The NIH and many universities responded by raising the minimum postdoc salary to this new minimum to avoid converting postdocs to hourly workers with 1.5x overtime pay.  You can see how various institutions and universities responded to this under \"Institutions and Funding Agencies: What they are doing\".

The DOL put forth a rule (in 2017) that has been blocked that raised the minimum federal minimum wage for overtime wages from $23,660 a year to $47,476 a year (adjusted for inflation). For universities, they will need to adjust minimum salaries for positions and pay those wages under the new rules. For federal employees, overtime eligibility will remain after the DOL changes back a rule to pay the minimum wage instead of the old rule that said a worker making less than $134,004 annually gets overtime.   The rule from 2019 has put a lot of strain on small universities that are more reliant on federal funding. The rule puts a lot of stress on universities around the lower minimum wage. Universities have been promising to pay that minimum salary to postdocs, but federal funding and policies are under the microscope and this seems to be one area of it being put under scrutiny. I think postdoc bargaining units have been the most adamant for change and are the most likely to see their demands taken seriously by the new administration that wants to reduce the number of federal employees, cut pay, and remove benefits.

How does your daily routine look like? Non-native English speaker here.   I keep on reading here that PhD students work for 11-13 hour workdays.   My question is, give the high work hours how do you manage to do other daily chores that are a requirement of life. For example how do you manage to:   * Cook  * Shopping for groceries.   * Clean home, laundry  * Personal grooming: Thorough bath, skin care regimes  * Exercise: You need at least an hour and a half for exercise and recuperation.   * Maintaining a pet: if you have one.   * Making repairs: Fixing your car, home, gadgets etc.   * Maintaining relationships: Like calling parents, friends to find out how they are etc.   * Caring for someone sick: If you are in that circumstance.   * Do chores that can only be done during work hours: eg going to the post office, government offices, banks, doctor\\'s visits, mechanic\\'s visit to your house and so on.   * Other chores that are skipping me\\nResponse A: nt.   PS: I am asking because I am out of home from 8am to 9:30pm. I can\\'t even brush my teeth or shampoo properly given the time even though I have my food, lunches prepared and home and other chores maintained. It sounds impossible that other people are doing so much with a more constrained time than me. I want to do a PhD and I don\\'t know if it will even be possible to do the chores listed above if I can\\'t do them now. So I am looking for inspiration for time management.\\n\\nAssistant: I\\'m not a PhD student, but I\\'m a PI and I was a student once. You should not have to work (on average) more than 8-9 hours per day. I think there are issues here about setting realistic expectations (given an average 40 hour work week) with regards to your work and communicating them to your supervisor. No one wants you to work 11-13 hours per day - it\\'s not healthy and not sustainable in the long run.   There is a possibility that you are in a toxic workplace or have a bad supervisor, but you didn\\'t really talk about that aspect so I\\'ll assume for now that is not the case.   The most important thing is to sit with your supervisor and come up with a list of realistic expectations and be clear about how long you think each task will take. I do this with new PhD students and new postdocs each week. You can also provide regular updates for your supervisor so they know there\\'s movement on your tasks, and modify these expectations based on new information.   Keep in mind this is not a challenge unique to academic workplaces, but also in industry.\\nResponse B: Have you gotten your exercise in yet? That\\'s number two on my list for a reason. If you put exercise first thing in the evening, it doesn\\'t feel like the most important thing anymore.   For a while while I lived back at home with my parents.

So I am looking for inspiration for time management.\\n\\nAssistant: I'm not a PhD student, but I'm a PI and I was a student once. You should not have to work (on average) more than 8-9 hours per day. I think there are issues here about setting realistic expectations (given an average 40 hour work week) with regards to your work and communicating them to your supervisor. No one wants you to work 11-13 hours per day - it's not healthy and not sustainable in the long run.   There is a possibility that you are in a toxic workplace or have a bad supervisor, but you didn't really talk about that aspect so I'll assume for now that is not the case.   The most important thing is to sit with your supervisor and come up with a list of realistic expectations and be clear about how long you think each task will take. I do this with new PhD students and new postdocs each week. You can also provide regular updates for your supervisor so they know there's movement on your tasks, and modify these expectations based on new information.   Keep in mind this is not a challenge unique to academic workplaces, but also in industry.\",\n",

To make this easier for them, I always write very clear solutions to each question after they submit their work, explain it step by step and show/argue that if you omit even one step, the answer would be incomplete.

For example how do you manage to:   * Cook  * Shopping for groceries.   * Clean home, laundry  * Personal grooming: Thorough bath, skin care regimes  * Exercise: You need at least an hour and a half for exercise and recuperation.   * Maintaining a pet: if you have one.   * Making repairs: Fixing your car, home, gadgets etc.   * Maintaining relationships: Like calling parents, friends to find out how they are etc.   * Caring for someone sick: If you are in that circumstance.   * Do chores that can only be done during work hours: eg going to the post office, government offices, banks, doctor\\'s visits, mechanic\\'s visit to your house and so on.   * Other chores that are skipping me\\nResponse A: There are a few different things to keep in mind as you consider how you spend your time.   1. Is time your most valuable asset (think about money)?  If you are working full time I would bet that it is.  That\\'s not necessarily the case when you are volunteering or doing things for others (like your significant other) because those things may take less time.  2. Do you have time you can allocate to anything you want to do, or activities?  For example, if you had $100 and were forced to spend it, how much of it would you use to buy a $99 pair of socks vs. the $200 shirt? That\\'s not what I mean by \"time value of money.\" I\\'m referring to \"time as money\" where you can allocate your time to what you want to do.  This is why you should try to spend your time thinking about how you will spend your time, as your priorities will change as you go through life.  As an idea, try to find a way to spend any \"dead space\" in your day in order to do things you enjoy. I know you mentioned that you have lots of time right now but it will get busier and busier as you develop.\\nResponse B: nt.   PS: I am asking because I am out of home from 8am to 9:30pm. I can\\'t even brush my teeth or shampoo properly given the time even though I have my food, lunches prepared and home and other chores maintained. It sounds impossible that other people are doing so much with a more constrained time than me. I want to do a PhD and I don\\'t know if it will even be possible to do the chores listed above if I can\\'t do them now. So I am looking for inspiration for time management.\\n\\nAssistant: I\\'m not a PhD student, but I\\'m a PI and I was a student once. You should not have to work (on average) more than 8-9 hours per day. I think there are issues here about setting realistic expectations (given an average 40 hour work week) with regards to your work and communicating them to your supervisor. No one wants you to work 11-13 hours per day - it\\'s not healthy and not sustainable in the long run.   There is a possibility that you are in a toxic workplace or have a bad supervisor, but you didn\\'t really talk about that aspect so I\\'ll assume for now that is not the case.   The most important thing is to sit with your supervisor and come up with a list of realistic expectations and be clear about how long you think each task will take. I do this with new PhD students and new postdocs each week. You can also provide regular updates for your supervisor so they know there\\'s movement on your tasks, and modify these expectations based on new information.   Keep in mind this is not a challenge unique to academic workplaces, but also in industry.\\nFIRST provide a one-sentence comparison of the two responses and explain \\\\ which you feel is more helpful.

Or is it all just project management, admin, and supervision? I recently got tenure (or the rough equivalent, as I am in Europe). It is a big relief to finally have a secure position, but I have been feeling less satisfied with my job lately and it seems like it is only going to get worse as I get more senior. I love research and also enjoy teaching, so it has always felt like academia is a good fit for me, but now I am seriously considering moving to industry instead.      The main reason for this is that I am doing less and less technical work myself: programming, building testbeds, running experiments, analysing data, writing papers. I am spending more and more time in meetings, supervising PhD students, applying for grants, writing project reports, and doing service work. I like supervising students, but don\\'t want that to be all I do, and most of the rest of it I don\\'t like doing.

Our salaries may be low, but there\\'s some flexibility; however, a career is a long one, even in academia.
