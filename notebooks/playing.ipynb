Perhaps I am wrong to say this, but the only way you can be sure of someone cheating is if you actually know them, and that is extremely rare.  However, sometimes cheating is difficult to detect because the teacher can only look so close at a paper or test solution to be sure it's cheating.  In which case cheating means simply passing an assignment that you are more familiar with or that has less of a chance of being discovered. For instance, if you have never written a report on your field, a teacher may not realize that you didn't write your own because they assume that every report, in the same class, follows a certain format.

The most common methods I know of are 1) copying information that was revealed to the student in class or explicitly by the professor, and 2) taking the ideas of someone else and writing it up in their own words.\\n\\nCopying information from class is generally not viewed as “cheating” because it's only cheating if the information was explicitly given, and it might actually be the law to copy it. In fact, it's very common in a lot of places. For example, there is a website called Coursehero that is just a database of information on classes from around the country, and you can use it as a study guide, without copying anything. This is a grey area, but you definitely don't want to copy it.

For instance, a doctor can’t be fired for malpractice in a state that has such a rule without presenting a reasonable defense that he should be exempt on the basis of the grandfather rule. In this case, in the state of California you cannot sue the school or any faculty member without presenting evidence that you can prove, and that evidence has to be so specific and specific that it cannot be proven that the fraud went on over such a long period of time.

I’ve found that getting involved with a personal learning project that feels rewarding can help rekindle passion in graduate school, and you can follow those interests or skills with some new learning project and see how they fit with your passion.  If you start with some easy learning project, that also feels rewarding and can support you in a larger project, you will have established the habit of engaging with your passion, and that can be invaluable experience for future learning.  \\nIn addition to the practical benefits of building habits, it can also be really motivating for me to learn how to solve problems with the skills I want to develop, and that feels like a huge privilege.

I'm a PhD student in a Pharmacology program.  I don't work 12 hours a day.  I work closer to 7-9 hours during the week and pick up a couple of hours on the weekend if I need to for experiments/deadlines.  On average, I work 40-50 hours a week.  A weekday for me would look something like this (no classes):  * 6:15 AM: wake up, get ready (hair, makeup, feed cat, etc), brush teeth, check the weather, eat a light breakfast like cereal * 7:45-8:15 AM: arrive to lab, look at my list of duties and calendar, plan my day, work, read, etc * 4:45-6:15 PM: get home, this varies depending on my workday * 4:50 PM: Go for a jog (~3-4 miles, 30 minutes) * 5:30 PM: shower/meal prep * 6:00 PM: dinner and netflix/hulu/TV * 7:00 PM: feed and love cat/clean up/dishes/start laundry/grocery shop/etc * 8:00 PM: check e-mail/read/free-time * 10-11 PM: sleep  There is a lot that can vary in this schedule in the evening for me based on my needs.  I have a lot of time to spend to grocery shop, run errands, do laundry, clean, maintain personal hygeine, etc.  Honestly, you just have to make time for chores and the other things on your list like any other working adult.  Some tips I have that make my life easier:  * The slow cooker is one of my best friends for cooking.  I'll throw in some meat with seasoning in the morning on low, come home, shred it, chop up some veggies I picked up from the store the night before, and I have some easy meat and veggies for tacos or a rice bowl.  I make a bunch so I have leftovers to freeze or refridgerate. * If you have trouble picking out clothing or getting ready in the morning, set out your clothes the night before * When you're at work, spending time working.  Oftentimes, if I hear of a PhD spending 12-14 hours a day in the laboratory, I can almost guarantee that person is not constantly working while they are there or their advisor is a jerk.  Take breaks, sure, but set out your tasks ahead of time and work to get them done. * Planning a schedule or writing down my work tasks for a day helps me manage my time at work better than just keeping a mental note of all the things I need to do. * No one tracks my hours so if I need to step out to go to the post office or to a dr's appointment during the day I can.  No one gets upset at me.  Just make time for those things. * For a pet, I have a cat.  My cat does a pretty good job at maintaining herself without me there all the time.  I feed her in the morning, feed her at night, clean her litter box, and spend some time with her.  She doesn't need constant monitoring, she's a pretty low maintenance pet to have.

You should not have to work (on average) more than 8-9 hours per day. I think there are issues here about setting realistic expectations (given an average 40 hour work week) with regards to your work and communicating them to your supervisor. No one wants you to work 11-13 hours per day - it's not healthy and not sustainable in the long run.   There is a possibility that you are in a toxic workplace or have a bad supervisor, but you didn't really talk about that aspect so I'll assume for now that is not the case.   The most important thing is to sit with your supervisor and come up with a list of realistic expectations and be clear about how long you think each task will take. I do this with new PhD students and new postdocs each week. You can also provide regular updates for your supervisor so they know there's movement on your tasks, and modify these expectations based on new information.   Keep in mind this is not a challenge unique to academic workplaces, but also in industry.\",\n",
       "  'policy_response': 'There are many different ways to manage your time. One of the most useful ideas is to look at the following framework to consider various types of tasks and priorities in your day:   * Your time should be divided into three equally-sized time periods:   1.

When your work is focused, you can do your best work and feel the most productive.   It\\'s very important to spend a significant amount of time in the \"Recuperation\" period each day. The recuperation period provides a time to recover from the day\\'s activities and gives your body and muscles some rest. Make sure your recuperation period is consistent, and that you allow it to fully happen and end at least for a few days a week.

You should not have to work (on average) more than 8-9 hours per day. I think there are issues here about setting realistic expectations (given an average 40 hour work week) with regards to your work and communicating them to your supervisor. No one wants you to work 11-13 hours per day - it's not healthy and not sustainable in the long run.   There is a possibility that you are in a toxic workplace or have a bad supervisor, but you didn't really talk about that aspect so I'll assume for now that is not the case.   The most important thing is to sit with your supervisor and come up with a list of realistic expectations and be clear about how long you think each task will take. I do this with new PhD students and new postdocs each week. You can also provide regular updates for your supervisor so they know there's movement on your tasks, and modify these expectations based on new information.   Keep in mind this is not a challenge unique to academic workplaces, but also in industry.\",\n",

The \"maximal effort\" approach \\n\"If you have to make a choice, pick the one with the optimal outcome.\" This approach is about optimizing results and minimizing frustration.   2. The \"relative importance\" approach \\n\"If you have to do these two things right now, pick which gets completed first, and once that is done, choose the next.\" This approach is based on minimizing the amount of time spent worrying about which tasks are most important.

This is a tricky and important question, and I think there are many aspects of consideration that deserve some exploration before making the final decision.  For a PhD or Masters degree in any field to be feasible, you will likely need to find a university in a reasonably remote location with excellent childcare facilities.  This can only be done if there is support from employers and financial aid institutions, and often requires a substantial investment of time and energy in obtaining funding or job offers in more distant locations.  Many scientific fields require significant time away from your child, so it is important to choose a subject and university that is compatible with your family and child-rearing priorities, or consider delaying a PhD/Masters to raise your child full-time.  In these situations, daycare can be an option, although this might be less feasible if raising a child alongside a PhD/Masters program is not possible.  Lastly, it will be challenging to work and raise a child during these years, but the experience gained through hands-on scientific work will be valuable and will ultimately be worthwhile, as long as your childcare support and time management is realistic, efficient, and prioritized.

There are many programs in many disciplines that have simply suspended their normal intakes of graduate students, especially programs where there is simply no way to avoid having people in close physical proximity together in the course of doing professional training and research. So you need to not come to any fixed or final view of your qualifications or chances of admission under more normal circumstances, which hopefully will come back into view in the 2022-23 academic year (and thus will influence applications this coming fall).   However, if you want to look carefully to see if there's any issues in your applications that you can improve on before the next application cycle, the very best thing you could do is to show your applications from this year to a trusted undergraduate professor that you worked with--and if you had any peers or friends who were majors in Psychology at your university alongside you, show them too.   The other thing to keep in mind is even if it's true that the jobs you applied for were ones you were qualified for and should have been considered for, keep in mind that the atypicality of this year applies to those applications, at least since March 2020. It may well be true that many of those opportunities have gone to people who were known to the people running the lab as well, but you have to find a place to put your legitimate frustration and anger with that possibility out of mind temporarily while you are working on your applications--it can affect how you present yourself and your candidacy in ways that you might not pick up on.\",\n",

It isn't enough to have students, even if most students are coming for the first time, who aren't the people that we need; we have to attract and recruit students who are the people that we need.

I feel extremely confident that my degree helped me get to where I am now, but many others who have similar backgrounds to yours haven't had the same success. So, if your goal is to be a researcher, it's important to be realistic about what skills and background you bring to the table.

Clinical psych programs are also very competitive, and I'm hearing moreso this year. If you want to go research, look more into non-clinical programs, which it sounds like you are doing with Cog neuro programs. This area can fall into different programs including neuroscience and psychology, so look broadly.   For RA positions, applying across the country might actually be hurting you. For some reason, I've known a few people who like to hire RAs that would not be moving. Their rationale is they want them to be likely to accept the job, and many of these jobs have a probationary period and people don't want someone to move across the country and then lose their job after 3 months. Not saying this is the right reasoning at all, but there is a chance your application is getting tossed when they see you live far away.   Do you have any mentors or profs you were close with at your undergrad institution? They might be able to help you network. Otherwise, sadly, the level of competition is stiff. Try to get on papers and posters. I actually value an undergrad who presented their own poster, even if at a local school event, over an undergrad who probably just got lucky to be a middle author on a paper they didn't lead. Look for diversity fellowships. There are lots of them and I encourage you to contact future PIs and tell them you'd like to apply to fellowships. If you are free, you are hard to turn down! Look at the conferences in. your field, many have diversity scholarships that would pay you to go to the conference- great networking and an award to put on the CV. Best of luck!\",\n",

While some people are very lucky and snag a research fellowship immediately upon graduation, the most successful PhD candidates I know get rejected quite a bit and go on to work for several years in the industry before deciding they want to return to school. You should probably start looking into CogNeuro PhD programs instead of the much more competitive PhD programs in psychology (and consider other relevant PhD programs for other fields in addition to philosophy and neuroscience). The CogNeuro PhD programs usually offer generous stipends and fellowships, and I think this is a very worthwhile consideration.  You might also contact the graduate programs at some of the top psychology PhD departments, as many of them offer small, highly-selective PhD training programs, with stipends and fellowships. The UC Berkeley Graduate Group in Cognitive Science might offer the Ph.D. Program in Cognitive Science, as well as the psychology graduate program.  The Harvard Psychology PhD program also might have some programs that are more focused.

I think there are two ways to react to this, positive and negative. The positive way to handle this is to make yourself less reactive to criticism. As a junior researcher, my experience is that if there’s a problem with one project, the first thing you should do is ask questions about the problem, then think about potential solutions.

I’m about two months into my job and I’m already struggling with how the people in it make me feel. I work directly under a Post Doc with a supervising professor, along with a few other researches scattered here and there.   My biggest issue right now is that with my supervisor (post doc) I always feel like she’s looking down on me and she’s told me a few times already she needs me to take more initiative and get things done. My problem with that is that there ain’t always work for me to do everyday and what we need to get done is never laid out, exactly when she wants to do it and when it should get done. I’m grasping at straws and I’m trying to keep up with all the information they are telling me about the current study we are doing and I’m extremely overwhelmed.',\n",

The professor should be able to give you an honest conversation on what’s going on.   I’d also suggest that if the professor doesn’t really understand the work either, she should be open to letting you learn at your own pace, so that together you can understand what’s really going on.

There are also various strategies with making it your own joke, like having fun with how they don’t like your accent, but that they think it’s funny.

But this was also a self-reported survey, so it’s possible that other groups of people have a different experience.  For example, in another study, we found that users of the Kindle app read on average 40 minutes of magazines and newspapers per day, and about 40 minutes of Kindle books. But this was also based on self-reported data, and while some of the users may be reading online articles on their mobile device, we couldn’t rule out that some of them were not reading these articles on mobile device.

Some people use their phones as a sort of pocket reference library, storing papers they want to review later.  And other people will use their phones to find papers that interest them, since they can search for keywords and download articles directly from their phone.  One other trend I’ve observed is that papers are increasingly mobile-friendly, so you can usually get them in a mobile-optimized view.

While the technology makes the task slightly easier than on a desktop, and does make reading articles less of a burden, it also makes reading in the traditional ways - i.e. by printing or copying - less of an option.  This is because the physical qualities of a mobile device (its size, weight, power source, battery life, etc.) do not always allow for printing, copying, and other activities with a printer or photocopier.   At present, a mobile device is a good option for reading a brief article or two while commuting, but isn’t the best option for studying deeply or for taking extensive notes.    There’s a growing library of high-quality apps which allow reading and annotating documents on a mobile device, which are designed to help with this.  Unfortunately, these apps aren’t compatible with all publications, they aren’t integrated into all reading environments, and they aren’t designed to be used for multiple articles.  For example, my favorite mobile reading app, called “PDF Reader”, is good at reading individual articles (i.e. it provides some basic annotation functions) but not best for reading dozens of articles within a single document.  Finally, many mobile applications for reading, while useful, aren’t quite designed to be “lightweight” in the way that the concept is used here.

People also complain about the size of most reading apps - not many people are willing to spend time to read on an extremely tiny screen, so that's a challenge in itself.  But there is also a wider cultural trend, that reading is for people who are not in high energy environments, who can just sit down and read at home, on the train, around the house, etc.  So while some people want to read books on paper, others want to read on screens and tablets.  But I think the underlying culture is that some reading should be done in quiet, and other reading should be done with music and some of these, like listening to music while commuting, really depend on a certain type of activity or mood.  This also means that I don't want to force people to read while commuting.  I would prefer if mobile phones could include some sort of built-in reading app, so people could pick up a book and read it wherever they wanted.

I love reading and I'm also someone that does many different types of writing, and I find that some papers that I love getting through might not be especially readable and easy to work with.  I usually read papers more than once, usually several months (or a year or two) apart, and each reading is a little bit of a different read.  You might consider reading a paper more than once, but you also might prefer to work with a paper once and forget about it, as the ideas sink in over time, or you might prefer to take time between readings to let your thoughts evolve as you work on your ideas.  I do also find that it's helpful to read the same paper multiple times, both to get at ideas at different stages (so I'll probably read the paper once to get all the points I want to make, then a second time to put those points together into a coherent statement), but also because you don't necessarily have to read everything, and it can be nice to read some things more than once, just to make the ideas more compelling.  You might also do this to learn different ways of thinking, as papers often do very different things (and this is a good thing!).  I sometimes read papers several times, and you might also find yourself going back and forth between two papers and you might find that a particular area in a paper you're reading seems to be more compelling or interesting, so then you read that paper in full, or perhaps you can return to it later as a reminder.  Sometimes I don't read a paper at all if I know I'm not ready for it.  If I'm doing something like programming a new algorithm, then I know that I'm not going to understand the paper yet, and the idea of reading a paper without doing anything with it is unproductive.  This is the reason why I don't read papers directly without understanding the context I'm working in, and I'll also often read through a paper multiple times to see the different ideas that are expressed.\"},\n",

       "  'policy_response': 'Oh, good question! There are several ways to organize and remember papers, depending on what type of research topic you study.  I\\'ll start by first saying that, while a \"system\" is useful, an effective one really is made up of lots of little habits that you develop over many years of reading and writing, so it isn\\'t so much a specific system as a combination of personal strategies that work for you in your context.  I would be glad to help you come up with a specific system, or to share mine.  However, I definitely think it\\'s important to note that, if you start writing things down right now it will take about 6 months for that to become a natural habit and begin to be effective, so I would really recommend you start taking notes as soon as possible.  Here are some examples of systems I think might be useful in your situation: \\n\\n\\n  - If you feel like your paper is very important to you and you want to remember all the details about it, you might make a long bullet-point document that summarizes the entire paper, with key ideas underlined, notes on your key takeaways and related passages highlighted, and so on.  Try to get into a rhythm of making these lists every few days, since this is a great way to keep these ideas top-of-mind for future reference.  There are multiple ways to do this, I personally like putting the key ideas or most interesting pieces on card-sized sticky notes and sticking them in the paper so I remember them right away.  Alternatively, you might print out the whole paper to have a hard copy and highlight sections you want to keep in mind.\\n\\n  -    If you want to keep track of many papers and remember the big ideas in the paper without trying to summarize them all by hand, it is very helpful to start using note-taking software like Evernote or OneNote, and to type up your thoughts as soon as you read a paper.

You should know your audience very well.   To learn about academic writing and to improve, you'll also need to understand what works well in your own voice. You'll need to understand what you like about it, what makes it successful so you can apply those ideas to your own writing. You'll need to find writers who you truly enjoy reading, and consider why you enjoy them. The more you read, the more you'll find that there are various aspects of writing that can work quite well, but not for everyone.

If the student continues to be dishonest, you should file a formal appeal, since your actions will reflect negatively on the school and other students.

Second, you should always be making sure your paper contains thorough, coherent arguments and explanations. The best approach is to write your paper with one question in mind: What if this is true?

The researchers who wrote these articles work for the universities that want them to publish in their journals.  The universities do not own the intellectual property or the rights to use this material for marketing, but the researchers themselves often do.

If the researchers want their work to be published publicly, that should be agreed over in advance of writing the material, so that they can claim their share of the intellectual property.  If an article is published widely on a public website, and no agreement to this effect is in place, the author will normally lose any commercial or material benefit.

A trickle to begin, one or two a year perhaps. Then more. Then lots.  That being said, I'd suppose it depends on where one is within their field rather than arbitrary markers in specific departments. An editorial board neither really knows nor cares about things like comps or departmental progress, all they want to know is if the person has specific expertise and can comment with a high degree of mastery on a certain topic. For most people that starts after a PhD, for many it will be in their masters or early PhD. Perhaps a few people would make it into a postdoc without having being asked. All depends on the quality, significance, general reputation of what their important (ie: well-regarded publication in a well-regarded journal) contributions have been. And, as in all things in this world, it's very field dependant, so this is going to vary a bit.  The other thing is that there's a lot of publishing and not nearly enough qualified academics to do PR. This is actually a major crisis, and one of the many reasons why quality of publications have been really falling. Too many publications and not enough adjudicators.

Scientists have historically relied on scientific referees to provide this feedback and to guide and facilitate their research -- this has been the traditional method of scientific publication for over 200 years. But how peer review actually works, what peer review is for, and when and why you receive it, has changed quite a bit over time.

The peer reviewer can also be someone you know, and they usually have extensive experience and know you well. Also, for peer reviewers to feel comfortable providing this feedback, they need to feel that you will be respectful of their input. For example, if you are writing a manuscript and you ask a friend to review it, they might not be super familiar with the academic style and language and may comment on it -- for example, \"Why has the title changed?\" or \"This needs to be in the third person\", or \"Does this sentence make sense?\"  However, if you ask a peer reviewer who doesn\\'t know you, they may feel more comfortable providing more detailed feedback and advice on how you can revise your paper or approach to be published. This is also why the peer reviewer may provide more detailed feedback, to guide your work, rather than just giving it the thumbs up or down.  \\nAcademics writing about a new topic which hasn\\'t been written about before:'},\n",

In physics, in particular, there is a well-known peer review protocol for the Journal of Physics B, developed in 1992, which dictates specific guidelines on who is to provide peer review, and how to conduct such. Most journals follow this protocol, or something similar to it, and generally only senior research physicists with a solid track record of papers can be asked to review. This process of peer review provides an additional layer of checks and balances for quality control, and at the same time provides guidance on how to improve articles in an objective manner. As you mention, peer review in science is generally well understood and common, and at this point you are quite well-established among other junior research physicists -- this practice is a natural path of career development, both in terms of the quality of your work and also in terms of who you are as a researcher.

The basic flow is as follows: Peer review requests come into the review process via e-mail, and you typically have 5-7 days to reply. If you reply with a request for a revision, the reviewers will review your changes, and provide feedback on the changes. If you reply with a no-opinion response, the reviewers will also generally offer their feedback for your consideration.

In an ideal world, the process is conducted by an anonymous set of external experts, and is designed to help you improve your project and your final article. As part of your education and professional development, one of the major goals of graduate school and postdoc training is to get your research and articles peer reviewed, and to learn how the process can be improved. As far as I understand this process, it is often also a requirement for getting your work published in academic journals. In my experience with the peer review process, first the reviewer usually asks to see the draft, after that, the reviewer reads the draft, asks for revision based on concerns, provides feedback, then the reviewer sends their final review. Then, the process repeats, until the reviewer feels the final review is enough, and the work is ready for publication.  While getting the process started is somewhat unpredictable, there is a general trend in how many reviews are needed, and how long the process takes, and how many authors it occurs with.  For your case, I find that the number of reviews needed is generally proportional to the number of authors, the authorship order, and the number of revisions. The timeline, however, differs greatly from study to study. I find that it generally takes between one to three month to get an initial review from reviewers, and around one week to get the final review from the external experts.  If you're a junior author, the timeline is likely longer, but if you're a senior author with a team of peers and collaborators it should be faster.\"},\n",

Overall, I'm in a position where I am conflicted, and torn on how to proceed in academia. I think mostly, I am looking for some advise from other academics who have had similar experiences, or who have any insight in what I can do.    I have been at the same institution for almost 10 years now. I was an undergrad student, research assistant, grad student, adjunct, substitute lecturer, instructor, assistant professor, director of a lab, and director of the undergraduate program for 2 years. I was able to do all this within a 6 year time frame. Recently, I have been out on parental leave. I have worked extremely hard to climb the academic ladder, and I feel pretty content with how successful I have been.   Here is where the real fun comes in.

To top things off, my wife was a high risk pregnancy (2 prior miscarriages) and my mom had stage 4 lung cancer. My mom ended up passing on Aug 14th of this year. From diagnosis to her passing, it was 5 months. To say this took a toll on me is an understatement. Meanwhile, the chair knew everything I was going through, and her response to my mom passing was \"time to get back to real life\". My leave officially started in October, and I received emails that were full of things that should not be said to anyone let alone someone already struggling with other life experiences. I\\'ve been in contact with the dean and she just says \"I dont know why she treats you like this\". The chair says \"hes like a son to me\" as if its some excuse to justify the abuse. She threatens that there are consequences, and told me I am shooting myself in the foot for now doing what she says. This was sent to the dean, union, and legal counsel. They told her to leave me alone during leave, but it will, without a doubt continue. After forwarding the harassing emails, the dean went MIA and hasn\\'t said a word in months. I got in contact with my union, legal counsel and HR and they basically told her to leave me alone. From October until this past week, she left me alone. Now the emails start again. Nothing toxic, but right back to as if things are normal and what she did is just acceptable. This experience is only the recent one, I have recordings, and emails from the past 10 years of things similar and perhaps worse. She is short tempered, and respects no one. She, and other say its just her culture (shes turkish). Its still mind boggling to me that if this were any other job, she would have been fired. There are recordings others have sent the union of her being racist. Yet, she still continues as if nothing has happened.   The overall response from the dean was \"I need her as chair\". The chair is tenured, and intends to retire in 3 years. I don\\'t want to see, hear or have anything to do with this woman. Just the thought of speaking with her gives me extreme anxiety. I wish this was an exaggeration, but every single interaction I have had with her has been abusing, toxic. Sadly, I am not alone in this. There has been at least 6 people who have left because of her, and the union said they aren\\'t sure why she is still here. yet nothing is done, and the dean and other just say \"that is just how she is\".

No need to sugar coat anything, because I need to hear what needs to be said. I have justified the abuse, and have been convinced by others that I just have to deal with her behavior.

I can see how important a journal is in establishing and nurturing relationships between scientists. To me, this really implies that journal reading needs to be fun and not a time-consuming task to be approached with suspicion. Therefore, I highly recommend that you make journal selection a joyful experience. In other words, I think the best way to make journal reading a positive experience is to select journals which you find exciting, and which you hope will introduce you to new ideas and topics, with which you might have little to no prior connections. I often use Mendeley to quickly skim a journal and choose which to read. In general, I would be very careful to choose a journal you are passionate about, instead of a journal you feel you could write for yourself. I think this is especially important for a review, but also for new work that you are excited about. * 2. Writing for publication and publishing often seem very different practices to me.

And this is not just true in personal life, but it is also true of scientific, academic communities.  And sometimes in an academic environment, it can be easy to get caught up in a cycle of self-doubt and negative feedback, only to find that the feedback is in fact misguided or incorrect, as we may not have considered all of the relevant factors.  This is a common issue in science, which is why it is particularly important to seek out objective feedback.

During my PhD, I had two advisors - 1 who was an assistant professor, and 1 who was a dept chair.  It was shocking to me to see the speed and \"ease\" by which many in the dept chair\\'s lab were able to publish in high impact journals as compared to trainees and post-docs in the assistant professor\\'s lab. Many studies which I thought were mediocre received strong reviewer response upon first submission, and it seemed the editors would often pick reviewers that the dept chair requested.  After I published several papers with each PI (corresponding author varied for each publication) - it became apparent that the network of the PI and relationship with the editor / reviewers was probably the most determining factor for success.  These days I dont really focus on the perceived quality of published works including my own, because data quality is only 1 factor of many that determines where works are published. The most important thing imo is to go to conferences, go to study sections, and build a strong network bc at the end of the day - it\\'s your colleagues (reviewers) and the journal editors that  determine where studies are published. Some PIs are able to publish high quality work based on the merits of their data alone without benefitting from network, but I think these are more rare cases than many PIs would admit.',\n",

To be honest, I do know that feeling: my own doctoral training was based in social psychology in the 90′s, before the modern field of personality psychology emerged with the likes of Daniel Gilbert and Paul Bloom. The scientific culture then was different, in many ways, but it was characterized by intense competition among individual scientists, each trying to \"prove their worth\" to one another in the \"best\" fields and academic institutions. Although of course the situation has improved, that \"survival of the fittest\" mentality still exists in the field today. It is certainly one of the reasons why the success of a lab is often not well-predictable, as is the case in your example.

If you want to learn something entirely new I suggest applying to a master's or PhD program. There are many great programs out there, some of which don't require undergraduate experience so you can still get research experience. Check out the website of the American Chemical Society for more information on grad school programs in chemistry.\"},\n",

This would be a way for someone to acquire the equivalent of research experience without going to grad school, and without having to go back to undergrad.  Unfortunately, I don't have personal knowledge of any graduate programs that offer such a path, there should be a way to find out more about it!

This is especially true when things are being discovered and theorized, since it can be very difficult to distinguish what is novel and fresh from what is repetitive and unnecessary repetition. In order to decide what to do with this information, many scholars actually take a kind of “backwards” approach: that is, they start with the most basic and basic information, and work backward through the theory and methods built on this. This gives us a sense of where things are heading and where the main issues are. This way of engaging with the field is actually quite common in many academic fields, and its principles are explained in a textbook by one of the most prominent philosophers at the University of Virginia, Keith Wark. As you read his book, one of the most obvious and useful things about his approach is that you can just ask around and everyone will tell you that the most central and important part of the field is the theory that the book you're reading is building on. This will not be the only theory that is built on it, but this will be the most fundamental one.  So this “backwards approach” is actually a very simple and direct way of understanding just\"},\n",

Here’s what I can tell you:  \\n\\nCiting Sources is required if you’re using information from an author to support an argument you make in your own writing.  Citing sources is often the best way to credit other authors for their work and prevent your text from being plagiarized. The main reason you want to cite your sources is so you can properly acknowledge the authors you’ve quoted. If you cite your sources clearly, it will make your work more credible and trustworthy.  \\n\\nCiting and paraphrasing are distinct from one another. Citing involves quoting directly from another’s work and making it clear who the author is, when and where the work was written, and what the source is (article, book, etc.). Paraphrasing is a useful alternative, and involves combining the ideas of two authors into a personal, well-formed statement.  \\n\\nSo, referencing means providing the exact text you're using directly from the source. Paraphrasing and summarizing are alternatives.  You could also use direct quotations for your reading. So long as you attribute your sources, you're on the right track.  \\nCiting sources helps your readers understand your point of view and the basis for your ideas.  Citing also serves to keep your work from getting plagiarized, which can cause serious problems for you or your school/company.

Make sure you have your cv ready and also have a few relevant samples to send to the committee for review, including any relevant work experience, including any conference talks you might have presented.

Depending on the size of the conference, there can be so many things happening at the same time in different parts of the venue, it’s easy to get lost in the sea of choices, so having a general game plan beforehand can be really helpful. 2) Be ready to be tired if you’re going to be attending multiple days. The first day is exciting and cool. By the third, the day drags on and every talk begins to sound the same. Being mentally prepared for that ahead of time can helps soften the impact if it. 3) A lot of connections happen after the conference. People will often go out afterwards to drink/talk and will be more relaxed. Great opportunity to try and (respectfully) make a connection. Sometimes the big vendors will host a party at a local restaurant/bar (you might see these advertised at a vendor exhibition showroom if they have one).

In contrast, research is a much more slow-paced field, and you can stay in it and keep building on your experience without really growing your pay.   In fact, it is actually more efficient for researchers to be very very careful and conservative about how much work they do, since they can keep the research going for years without being paid for it.   This all leads to the fact that for many people, the choice between research and software engineering is really not an economic tradeoff at all, but one of professional and personal fulfillment.

       "  'policy_response': 'Hm, this is an interesting question that’s been a topic of much debate in academia lately. It seems to me that a lot of the problem is due to two factors: first is the high cost of running a research program, in terms of infrastructure, facilities, and other costs. This creates a disincentive for a university to invest much of its scarce funds in research, especially if there are very few incentives for research faculty to conduct research themselves. This is partly due to the tenure system, where tenure-track researchers are expected to develop their own research in order to keep their jobs. This means that even though researchers may spend 10-20 times the amount of time working on research as they do working in their job, they can be paid much less since their salaries are more limited. \\nA related issue is the fact that research grants are very often “seed grants” rather than “federal grants”, which typically means that they are given to research centers. This means that research funds do not necessarily go to researchers but to institutes. It’s very easy for a researcher to get money for a research center, without having to spend the time to actually conduct research and have to justify the spending, since funding for the center is usually already budgeted. \\nThis may explain why you hear many of the same names repeatedly in academic careers: many individuals have developed skills and abilities to work in academic administration, and this also allows them to get paid more despite their low time spent working on research. \\nThis isn’t to say that research scholars have no role, since I agree that they definitely have valuable contributions to make. But there’s definitely a need for institutions to support early career researchers as well, especially in terms of funding and infrastructure costs.'},\n",

       "  'policy_response': \"There are several factors at play here. One important difference is that many research scholars are young and fresh out of college, and they're starting at the bottom of the compensation scale after graduating with a degree in fields like philosophy or English. While entry-level computer science jobs often require a master's degree, other disciplines only require a bachelor's. This makes it possible for more researchers to take these positions, while many of the top computer science programmers are already making significantly more money.\\n\\nThe other factor is that much of the research that takes place in academia is in collaboration with business and industry. This makes it difficult for researchers to find positions in academia alone, which limits the number of researchers who are eligible to pursue academic careers. Many academic positions are filled by people who already have other jobs in academia or business. Because of this, salaries for these researchers tend to be higher than those of similar computer science engineers.\\n\\nFinally, many researchers work in fields that require intensive knowledge of specific areas of science. For example, someone who studies chemistry may spend much of their research time learning about the chemical properties of a particular molecule, while a computer science researcher may spend most of their time coding and studying the fundamentals of algorithms. In addition to gaining skills and experience, computer science researchers often also have degrees and certifications in computer science, while researchers in other areas only have degrees in the fields they study, which limits their employability in the tech sector.

The undergraduates at Cambridge come into the university in September, and stay through the summer months as well.  So they get about 6 months of intensive instruction from their professor.  Then the students are \"on their own\" for the summer, to work on their own projects, take an internship and experience the wider world.  When they come back in September, the Professor continues teaching, but also there are additional lectures from the Master’s or Senior Tutor, to help the student further learn about life in Cambridge.  For the rest of the year the Professor is available one-on-one for private study, and also available in his office for a longer meeting time.  The students actually end up staying with one Professor for their whole time at Cambridge.  So even if the Professor dies during the term, the students continue with the same Professor, which can be a real bonding experience.  The Cambridge undergraduate course runs for about 6 or 7 years, or more if the student does their master’s degree there.  Cambridge has been doing that for a long time, so it’s old hat to them.  The only time that the undergraduate course varies is if there is an academic vacation or if there is an intersession, so there might be two semesters instead of the usual three, or some combination of shortened semesters and fewer vacations.  But the academic focus, and the time spent with one single professor for the entire time, is constant.  So the Cambridge course actually lasts a little longer.  I recommend it.  I went to Cambridge for grad school, and loved it.  I would recommend the Cambridge undergraduate course to anyone that is looking for a rigorous intellectual experience.  The US universities are starting to catch up, but their courses tend to be a little less intense,'},\n",

Instead, many researchers work in non-academic settings, such as government labs, non-governmental organizations (NGO), or in the private sector. Because of the different research priorities, tools, and training, there is no universal answer to how long it takes to stop feeling like you are drowning in a new research subject. However, there are a few points that can give a general sense of whether you are feeling overwhelmed or not.  First, it's important to consider that there are different levels of expertise, or levels of feeling overwhelmed. If you are not already familiar with the lab environment, you probably should not be diving in head first. A good strategy is to start by participating in small-scale projects, such as doing literature reviews, writing short papers, or becoming a part of a team for a longer one-time project. This can help you get acclimated into the new environment without being overwhelmed. If you do dive in head first, though, be sure that your mentors are actively involved in the process and don�t expect you to do all the work. For example, if you are working on a project and you don't feel up to doing all the work, but you are unsure if it's enough, talk to your mentor and ask what you can do to help out. Finally, remember that each one of these steps to getting used to a new research project is very important and won't be immediately done by yourself. There are many professionals in the field who will be there to give support and advice along the way. One of the wonderful things about biology as a research field is that the scientific community is extremely open, and so many researchers are interested in helping and supporting new grad students in their scientific careers.\"},\n",

Here is my take on it:\\n\\n-      To answer your core question about ethics:  Yes, as a peer review practice, it’s usually unethical for authors to submit manuscripts concurrently to different journals.  But why is that?  Because if the editor of journal-A received a manuscript for review and is evaluating that manuscript in a timely manner, it’s a violation of the journal’s review process to immediately send that manuscript to journal-B and ask them to review that manuscript concurrently.   The whole purpose of a peer review is to ensure scientific rigor.  The same manuscript, reviewed by another editor, may have just as many flaws and will not get the same scientific rigor.  One way around this ethical conflict is to allow the editor to hold the manuscript by both journals until both journals have reviewed the manuscript (a practice sometimes called “double-blind review”) and give both editors equal time to evaluate the manuscript independently and separately.  If you don’t want to put yourself or the researchers in the position of having to violate an ethical practice to get them on your resume, simply don’t help them.  But, if you want to submit a paper that’s more rigorous, and you would prefer that your reviewers work independently in a dual-blind manner (in which they don’t know the names of each person they’re reading), then you can ask the reviewers if they are willing to do that.  It’s worth noting, however, that dual-blind review is a very specialized case of review practices that many journals often'},\n",

The reason why authors are prohibited from submitting to multiple journals at the same time is that a journal’s editorial board relies on the impartiality of reviewers to ensure that submitted manuscripts are evaluated in a fair and appropriate manner by people who are neither affiliated with the authors nor with the journal. Reviewers are therefore required to disclose any potential conflicts of interest (such as professional or financial relationships with the authors or the institution of the authors) prior to commencing a review and to disclose any competing interests throughout the process.  In addition, many journals require that published manuscripts reflect an objective review of the paper, including specific comments about both strengths and weaknesses of the paper.  The reviewing of manuscripts under the names of other faculty members is therefore highly unethical, since the reviewer is not only not providing objective reviews of the paper, but is also not conducting themselves in a professional and impartial manner as they assume someone else’s professional identity.   It is therefore my opinion that submitting a manuscript under the name of another faculty member is a violation of ethical standards for both reviewers and the authors of the manuscript.

There are actually many reasons why scientists and mathematicians are leaving their academic careers in order to go into industry, and I think these three are among the most important:\\n\\n1) Lack of career advancement.

(2)  Another major issue is that academic positions have become increasingly tenured, while industry positions tend to be more on a contractual or freelance basis.  This has led to a situation where many scientists aren't given much financial stability.  On top of these main concerns, there are many secondary career obstacles for scientists, such as not being able to go to conferences and meet with potential employers because of time and money constraints.\\n\\n2) A changing scientific landscape.  In recent years, there has been major changes in the research landscape, for example, the amount of research funding that has become available for scientists.  A very common misconception is that funding for scientific research comes from tax dollars, but that is far from the truth.  Funding for research comes through two routes:  direct research grants and indirect grants.  The direct research grants come from agencies like the NIH, or the NSF, while indirect grants come from many different sources.  Here is a simple estimate for FY 2017:  The NIH alone received $35.7 billion in direct research grants in FY 2017, while their total indirect funding was over $70 billion in FY 2017.   On the other hand, it is estimated that the direct research grants for Chemistry went up 15% in FY 2017, and the indirect funding for Chemistry went down 30% in FY 2017.

Some of the most effective advisors focus on writing proposals and selecting excellent students to do the work with a low level of supervision. If you are publishing well, you are likely doing well under this model. Even more important is that you have the opportunity to practice teaching and mentoring among junior students, and identify new opportunities to leverage old acquired skills to benefit your field of research. Just because it doesn’t pertain to your project, the fact that it benefits other projects means it is probably useful in your general area (“non-thesis related work he does”). So, I think you are missing the point that your advisor has created an environment in which you can learn independence (crucial for a successful PhD) and to learn to guide others in an area of your expertise (crucial if you want to supervise/mentor students or post docs some day). You should feel complimented that he respects your expertise and feel honored that he trusts you enough to work on his project without much input. You don’t need to like him, and can certainly feel bitter for slow/negligible input.

What can I do about this?\\n\\nAssistant: Minimal guidance isn’t uncommon, and it often leads to very good independent PhDs. Some of the most effective advisors focus on writing proposals and selecting excellent students to do the work with a low level of supervision. If you are publishing well, you are likely doing well under this model. Even more important is that you have the opportunity to practice teaching and mentoring among junior students, and identify new opportunities to leverage old acquired skills to benefit your field of research. Just because it doesn’t pertain to your project, the fact that it benefits other projects means it is probably useful in your general area (“non-thesis related work he does”). So, I think you are missing the point that your advisor has created an environment in which you can learn independence (crucial for a successful PhD) and to learn to guide others in an area of your expertise (crucial if you want to supervise/mentor students or post docs some day). You should feel complimented that he respects your expertise and feel honored that he trusts you enough to work on his project without much input. You don’t need to like him, and can certainly feel bitter for slow/negligible input.   FWIW, I also worked in a relatively hands-off and high-expectations research group - with some guidance but also an unusual amount of independence (I wrote or contributed to five different proposals before graduating).

Right now the starting pay at most academic labs is under the national living wage, which is $15.25 an hour. This is significantly lower than the national living wage. This has been the case for a long time, and the fact that it is still true today is just how long it has taken for salaries at academic labs to catch up. While academic labs do often offer higher salaries than industry labs, at this time they are still below the national living wage.

The most common one, in my experience, is that you finish off your own paper.  > as first author, is this still your responsibility if you no longer work for those PIs  I find this a bit of an odd perspective.  The responsibility derives from the fact that you are first author: it is *your* paper, about *your* work.  None of that depends on who is paying your salary.  If you've left research and don't mind burning some bridges then sure, you can refuse to work on it and the professional ramifications will be fairly limited.

Many labs have a shared author agreement that can give the first author credit for the paper even if it wasn’t actually written by them. In many cases if you do the work and the result is not yet published but will be in the future and the reviewers say it needs significant changes, the correct course of action would be to have a conversation with the new PI in order to set an appropriate timeline to meet their timelines.   It also depends on the journal’s author agreement and your institution’s rules.

First, I want to draw your attention to the common mistake that this is a paper by your former lab members. In fact it is not, this is a paper you are publishing in your name after leaving your lab. Furthermore, your position change is not a break in research activities. However, your lab members in the past may play a role in your new research as you bring this paper to the new lab.  This is why you should be very careful about their name on the paper. But overall I think there is no problem with them or the lab contributing to your paper. To understand what your responsibilities are, we need to talk a bit about how your paper should be published. You submitted the paper to the journal when you were a member of the former lab. Then the paper went through a blind review where no one knew who wrote the paper. The authors and reviewers do not need to be the same in this process, so the paper can actually come from many authors but they need to make sure that all authors have an equal chance to participate.  There might still be the case that a reviewer is concerned with the potential conflict that your new role entails.

One of my colleagues, a pediatric neurologist who has studied ADHD in children, says one of the best tests of whether someone has a well controlled ADHD is how he or she responds to a crisis.  He says when parents bring their children to the emergency room with a migraine, a high fever, or other symptoms that make it urgent to be seen immediately, the doctor sees the child, listens for the child's history, then gives the patient a very short consultation and tells him or her to call back in a few hours and get seen again, or maybe in a few days when he or she can assess them further.  The child with ADHD is often brought back within 5 minutes, if not within minutes, because the doctor realises something is going on that he or she must not have missed.  That is what makes someone a good ADHD teacher.  The kid isn't running around, he listens closely, he says what he likes and what he doesn't like, he's respectful and polite, and he's more mature and stable than average.  That person is more likely to be engaged and productive in a classroom.  There's also something about being in the same environment and learning things in the same way at the same time, that can be really hard for children and also adults with ADHD.  If kids are doing a quiz or an exam and given a couple of pages per question, those children with ADHD often need more time to process and prepare their thoughts, but have to wait until everyone else is done to even get started on the next question.  It might take a kid with ADHD 40 minutes to an hour or more to fill out a quiz, whereas it usually takes a child without ADHD 20 or 30 minutes to fill it out.  So it's good that teachers are able and willing to be patient and flexible with their schedules.

There are significant funding cuts in most fields, and research is not always well-monitored for quality control or accountability across organizations.  When you present an idea, or an \"alternative\" approach, others will often raise concerns and criticize your work.  The primary reason for this is that they feel they\\'re being threatened by any ideas that are different from what the lab has traditionally done.

If this is the case, then you should absolutely try to appeal the decision you think is unjust because they might try to fire you to keep their bad reputation.  For instance, you might file a complaint with the university, asking for an investigation into the lab manager.  The university can then decide whether or not to continue to employ the lab manager.  This is the most effective option, I would say.  If someone abused their power and they were let go, then at least there was an investigation into the issue.

A professor would have to commit a crime or a serious scientific misconduct to lose their job, or a student would have to challenge the professor’s credentials or ethics to do so.  But there is some kind of “tenure” in the Humanities and Social Sciences.  In fact the very concept of “tenure” was invented by a philosopher called John Dewey because he was dissatisfied with the way philosophy was being done in his university.  \\nI’d say that there are two issues with tenure beyond the academic world.  The first is that tenured positions give a kind of power to academics and can result in social oppression, even within the academy.  The second issue is that the purpose of tenure has changed over time.  Tenured professors still expect their jobs to be secure even though the job market has really changed.  So many people still look for “tenured jobs”, and the job market is definitely not equal.  \\nI think your question is about the first issue.  It’s great that you’re concerned about the second issue, because there are a lot of ways professors can be “othered” in the academy, or excluded from the discussion or even research.  You can choose to discuss this issue in your research, just so you can show how it really works.  But there is also a lot of research you can talk about that is not necessarily your own!

In fact, it should be clear to anyone who has met with a faculty member that their primary work involves being an academic.  This involves many activities, including teaching and research, as well as service responsibilities within the department.  In addition, there is a whole infrastructure of committees, offices, and other governance structures that requires tenured faculty to devote significant time.  These activities take precedence over any other pursuit and are often more intense than many other jobs outside academia.  This is why tenured faculty typically have a fixed length appointment, and this is what’s used to assign them to chairs, even if they have a great deal to offer.  Similarly, there are many opportunities to develop new lines of research’ work that go beyond those that are currently funded, but these only come about if a tenured faculty member is sufficiently successful and productive.  \\n\\nThat said, this doesn’t mean that tenured faculty haven’t occasionally taken some “after-tenure” projects on.  Tenured faculty are very busy, and as you point out, this freedom to publish what they wish exists’for the right reasons.  I also don’t mean to say that all tenured faculty take the opportunity to pursue these projects.  In fact, many faculty only want to work on the projects that have been developed while in their positions as early career faculty and postdocs.

Tenure-track position -- a job in which the individual is required to hold a terminal academic degree before accepting the position, with the possibility of reappointment and promotion; 2. Tenure - a form of job security in the academic profession that protects the job security of its holder and allows greater freedom to pursue academic research and teaching than the faculty members are likely to have in other jobs. The tenure is generally for the length of the individual’s contract which guarantees the right to teaching and researching in the faculty member’s area of expertise. Tenure in the academic system is usually thought of as an arrangement whereby an individual can be kept on the faculty even if there is a temporary period of unemployment due to inadequate scholarship, or the failure to secure adequate funding and support for research and teaching. Tenure protects the job security of its holder and allows greater freedom to pursue academic research and teaching than the faculty members are likely to have in other jobs.  In practical terms, a person is said to have tenure when the university is legally bound to provide support for the individual’s job for as long as he or she desires. Tenured faculty at universities are usually paid based on the rate of salary in the United States (or some equivalent measure) and are often given the responsibility of leading or managing a department or university-wide project.  Tenure-line faculty with tenure enjoy benefits including the right to participate on various educational boards and the right to set their own schedules. A faculty member is commonly said to have \"tenure\" when he or she has received an offer of a permanent position, and is then required by university law to be kept on his or her position indefinitely until retirement.

Build your support network!  Thirdly, administration. It gets easier after the first year after you are in the system. I know it sucks to get all the cards and forms and applications filled in. But it WILL get simpler. After my third year I didn\\'t even blink an eye at the paperwork anymore, just keep on top of it! Do it immediately and keep copies of all the documents in a folder so when you have to apply for residene permits etc. again, you have it already.  Lastly, and probably the most important for you, your PhD and supervisors. I assume you are in your first year? Honestly, if you feel the need to quit do it. There is no shame in it and it takes immense strength to look at the big picture of your life and say \"This isn\\'t working\". But, if you feel you might want to continue, you\\'ll need to consider a few things. HR is not your friend. Seek counselling if you can (there should be free services available to you, speak to the International Researchers office of your university to find resources - ask for counselling options and help with administration). As for your supervisors - only you know how bad it really is. I would not directly approach your supervisors and tell them you\\'re not happy. I don\\'t think they would be receptive to this.  But I strongly advise you to learn the language of the country. STRONGLY. Spend this holiday time putting in the energy and work. It will help you  immeasurably. The fact is, you are in their country and you need to speak the language. If they laugh at your poor grammar, who cares as long as you can communicate! If you choose to stay, take their behaviour towards you as part of the PhD - you need to defend your ideas, vision, and data. Take it as a learning experience, you will be a force to reckon with when you succeed. Good luck!  Also, I know a large network of international PhD students all around the country, give me a PM if you need support.',\n",

I like to use examples to explain things clearly, and to use analogies rather than dry equations.  For example, in one recent paper that I published, I wanted to illustrate how “optical vortices” in a laser can behave in a way analogous to “rotational vortices” in a fluid, so I used the analogy of turbulence to describe it.  I also like to use vivid imagery, such as in writing about ultracold atoms.  In my recent article in Nature, I wrote that I was able to “dynamically interact” with the atoms, which is quite an evocative way of describing the effect I was hoping to do.  In my recent paper on cold atoms in optical lattices, I also tried to be as concrete and understandable as possible, such as using words like “sliding”, “draping”, and “peeling” instead of technical terms like “trapped”, “interacting”, and “caging”.  \\n\\n-  Another important aspect of communicating to people in a non-expert audience is being clear and concise.  I try to minimize jargon and use simple words where possible.  For example, instead of `superlattice` I like to use the word `lattice” to mean the same thing.  I also avoid introducing technical jargon that I don’t understand myself.

If it's a TT job, you should be aware that the job market in philosophy is beyond terrible. Look at this data: https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2021/04/where-the-tt-jobs-werent-in-2020-21.html  Granted, last year for hiring was an absolute garbage fire everywhere. But, say it doubles again over that data - there's still only ~10-15 jobs related to phil language every year.  If you're goal is to have an interesting experience and learn from interesting people, then go for it, especially if you are young, don't care where you live, and can live off ~$20k/yr.  If you want a PhD for some other reason, think hard about what those reasons are. You may develop some transferable skills studying philosophy, but no one outside of academia will give a shit that you have a PhD. If you were strategic, you could incorporate some linguistics or NLP into your studies (but this doesn't sound like your jam).  Finally, grad school spots in philosophy are super competitive. Depending on how much philosophy you did as an undergrad, you may need to take some post-bacc classes or audit some grad seminars in order to put together a decent application and find profs to write letters for you.  My advice, fwiw, would be to look into a funded MA - you can see if academic philosophy is really for you, and put together a really solid PhD application.  source: I am a PhD student in philosophy\",\n",

You mentioned that you’ve been inspired by living an \"examined\" life -- maybe we should start by emphasizing what this means.\\n\\nIn philosophy, \"examining\" can mean different things. In many ways, it’s asking questions -- the whole philosophical project, if you like, is to examine questions and argue about the answers. But in another, more practical way, we examine everything.  One way philosophy helps us in our day-to-day is by helping us recognize how we think about the world. We don’t just look at questions and arguments -- we look at our own beliefs, our own attitudes and values. We don’t see just how the world looks to us, but also how we look at the world, and how we see ourselves in it. Philosophy helps us become a better critical observer -- to think about the biases we have, and how we go about thinking about things.

The main issue for me is passion vs financial security. The things that would give me the most job options are uninteresting to me, and the things that do interest me…not a lot of career options.

Definitely not your job to do remedial logic/proof education, but I found it was helpful to clearly indicate the breakdown in reasoning -- red-circle the exact failures of logic -- and have an online intro-to-proofs primer you can direct students to.

For example, students in a high school algebra class might do practice problems to review the material for a test, but these problems are likely just as easy as homework assignments they\\'ve received. When the tests have passed, no one expects them to be able to apply basic algebra to problems on their own. The same goes for high school calculus students, who are prepared to do the calculus review problems for the final exam. But if the teacher assigns them calculus homework problems, or if they do their own independent calculus work, this is not a good sign, and the students don\\'t get the same academic credit for the material.

In other words, provide a disincentive for frivolous complaints.  Some kids will try to argue their grade almost no matter what, they\\'ve probably been doing it for years in all their classes.  This sort of thing happened to me in an intro to analysis class as an undergrad.  We had a friend who would write down the axioms, write down the theorem we were trying to prove, and then write down a bunch of nonsense in between.  When we called him on the nonsense he didn\\'t understand what we were talking about, so we\\'d have to explicitly disprove his \"proof\" to show why it wasn\\'t a proof.  He drove the TA nuts too.  I\\'m not sure how clearly you\\'re explaining/showing why the method is wrong, but you might want to be more explicit about it if you\\'re just taking off points without explaining exactly why.  It might take you a bit more time, which is annoying.  For instance, in response to, \"Every prime number other than 2 is odd since for example 3 is odd,\" you might write, \"One example doesn\\'t imply a proof.

I know it seems condescending to point out that their arguments don\\'t follow, but IME it was common to see even motivated upper-year students focus on duplicating examples while failing to grasp the underlying logic, and create \"proofs\" with non sequiturs, circular reasoning, and quantifier misuse. They understand fallacies when they\\'re put in a plain-English argument, but not in a symbolic argument.    Definitely not your job to do remedial logic/proof education, but I found it was helpful to clearly indicate the breakdown in reasoning -- red-circle the exact failures of logic -- and have an online intro-to-proofs primer you can direct students to. For a lot of them, they just haven\\'t spent enough dedicated time thinking about symbolic logic, and improvements come quickly.',\n",

I think the key question here is where the \"balance\" is, or whether there is a \"right\" level of detail. First, you know enough about this \"problem\" that it is probably not appropriate to put the \"correct\" answer in a homework, which makes sense. However, for a course taught by a particular professor, there is a range of appropriate answers. Here is an example of what I mean by this: A professor can expect students to do a set of problems before they come to class and can also expect students to perform a certain level of critical thinking and understanding. These two sets of things are not mutually exclusive: students are expected to perform the \"problem solving\" required by the professor, and also expected to demonstrate the critical thinking expected by the professor. So for the case that the professor has assigned homework, if the question is too complex for students to handle at the level required by the professor, it may be reasonable for the professor to skip this homework and just provide an answer. However, the most important point is that there are very different standards for the two tasks, and in fact, no one\\'s standard is'},\n",

My question is probably pretty stupid, but I looked up the keywords \"stress\" and \"deadline\" together and separately in this subreddit, and didn\\'t find what I was looking for. Here goes:   I\\'m a graduate student about to start my PhD program this coming fall. I just finished a masters by the skin of my teeth this past semester, and it was mostly due to my fault in dealing with deadlines and stress. Usually I try my best to plan for extra time to meet deadlines, but I sometimes miscalculate how much time I need to to complete things, and then get stressed out when I need to rush for a deadline. In this case it was my masters thesis... I am pretty good with short-term assignments, but that was my first time managing a project over a year long and needless to say the writing took a LOT more time than I expected it to. I get that I need to start planning smarter, and boy have I learned my lesson.

I've also upset my masters advisor for not meeting the schedule that we agreed upon.... I still can't breath well just thinking about it.   **How do you guys deal with the anxiety? Do you have tips or tricks for me to calm down and get to work properly? **  I want to fix this issue and improve before I start my PhD program, which is going to be much longer and I will be tied down with much more responsibilities (TA, more courses, etc.)... I hope this wasn't a total waste of your time. Thanks for reading.\\n\\nAssistant: Most universities have counseling support for graduate students. I found the PhD exponentially more stressful than my MA. A counselor helps manage stress and gives techniques for making progress in work while also acknowledging that the anxiety and the emotions still exist. A lot of schools also offer support groups where grad students get together once a week to help one another. You'd probably benefit from this.  There are a lot of books out there for help with grad school and writing. Silvia's How to Write A Lot is one and Booth's The Craft of Research is another. But I didn't find a magic key that told me how to succeed. I got finished because I had a daily schedule that I did 6 days a week and I really stuck to it.

This is a more common scenario than you think, and ethical analysis will be complex and dependent on the details. The issues are: 1. The quality of their work is compromised in a sense that they would not want to be published if they didn’t agree to include each other. 2. There is a level of exploitation on the part of one collaborator. 3. If one of the authors were to take over a project without their collaborators help, it would compromise the authorship arrangement. 4. It might be the case that two non-collaborators would write a paper together that they both benefit from, but where one contributes more than the other. 5. There is value exchange between the authors, because the other authors work on their paper.

       "  'policy_response': 'A really common barrier for success in PhD studies is the tendency to assume that research is the only valuable aspect of academia. In other words, PhD candidates often have an “approach before you know the answer” attitude, where you feel like being right is more important than having a meaningful conversation with others or actually accomplishing something. This is especially prevalent in academic fields that are more quantitative than qualitative. PhD candidates in these fields can often think that getting into publications and/or into the “right kind of talk” is the way to demonstrate your worth as a PhD candidate, and that doing research is just one of the ways to get there. For example, this attitude would be particularly prevalent in math PhD programs, which are often considered to be more quantitative than qualitative, even though that is not accurate. A more helpful attitude, especially in a field like math, would be to be more interested in contributing meaningfully to an academic conversation, rather than “doing math” or “doing research”.'},\n",

This is the scientific equivalent of voting in an election: it's an important part of democracy. So canceling a conference isn't like banning an election out of fear of a small minority of people (e.g. in the US). Rather it's like a judge canceling a debate or canceling a football game because there might be a slight chance of thunderstorms. In both cases, it's the judge or commissioner's responsibility to make decisions that allow the greater good to persist, and it's hard because he knows there could be some negative consequences.  \\n-In terms of etiquette, it would certainly be good to avoid stating explicitly that a conference was cancelled due to COVID.
